# CAPNTutorial
These are the files for my tutorial on setting up CAP'N. CAP'N is not included in these files, you can purchase it from the unity asset store.

I have issues with uploading the unity terrain files to github, they won't load correctly in the cloned repo. If anyone knows how to fix this please tell me. I apologise if the terrain doesn't work for you, you will have to make your own.
